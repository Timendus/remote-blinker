# Remote Blinker

This is a simple red-button-triggers-light script. We use it to allow our remotes to chime in on discussions, and give them a bit more of a real world presence.

## Installation

Get yourself a Raspberry Pi. Install Raspbian Stretch Lite on it. You will probably want to connect it to your WiFi through `raspi-config` and maybe enable the SSH server.

Then, git clone this repo onto your Pi and run `installOnRaspberryPi.sh`.
Finally, run `npm run client`, and you should be good.

That's what we've got so far ;)
